# state-design-pattern
We want to create a simple vending machine that dispenses different items based on its state. The vending machine can be in two states: "Idle" and "Dispensing". In the "Idle" state, it waits for a user to make a selection, and in the "Dispensing" state, it dispenses the selected item.
